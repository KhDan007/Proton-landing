                        </h2>
                        <p>The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a
                            long
                            period.
                            As early as 1815, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Prout">William Prout</a>
                            proposed that
                            all atoms are composed of hydrogen atoms (which he called "protyles"), based on a simplistic
                            interpretation of early values of <a

                                hypothesis</a>), which was disproved when more accurate values were measured.</p>
                        <p>In 1886, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Goldstein">Eugen Goldstein</a>
                            discovered

                            and
                            showed
                            that they were positively charged particles (ions) produced from gases. However, since
                            particles
                            from

                            (q/m),
                            they could
                            not be identified with a single particle, unlike the negative <a

                        <p>Following the discovery of the atomic nucleus by <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> in 1911, <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonius_van_den_Broek">Antonius van den Broek</a>
                            proposed that
                            the place of each element in the <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table">periodic
                                table</a> (its atomic number) is equal to its nuclear charge. This was confirmed
                            experimentally by
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Moseley">Henry Moseley</a> in 1913 using <a

                        </p>
                        <p>In 1917 (in experiments reported in 1919 and 1925), Rutherford proved that the hydrogen
                            nucleus
                            is
                            present in other nuclei, a result usually described as the discovery of protons.[22] These
                            experiments
                            began after Rutherford had noticed that, when <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle">alpha particles</a> were shot into
                            air
                            (mostly
                            nitrogen), his scintillation detectors showed the signatures of typical hydrogen nuclei as a
                            product.
                            After experimentation Rutherford traced the reaction to the nitrogen in air and found that
                            when
                            alpha
                            particles were introduced into pure nitrogen gas, the effect was larger. In 1919 Rutherford
                            assumed that
                            the alpha particle merely knocked a proton out of nitrogen, turning it into carbon. After
                            observing
                            Blackett's cloud chamber images in 1925, Rutherford realized that the alpha particle was
                            absorbed. After
                            capture of the alpha particle, a hydrogen nucleus is ejected, so that heavy oxygen, not
                            carbon,
                            is the
                            result – i.e., the atomic number Z of the nucleus is increased rather than reduced. This was
                            the
                            first
                            reported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reaction">nuclear reaction</a>, 14N
                            + α
                            → 17O +
                            p. Rutherford at first thought of our modern "p" in this equation as a hydrogen ion, H+.</p>
                        <p>Depending on one's perspective, either 1919 (when it was seen experimentally as derived from
                            another
                            source than hydrogen) or 1920 (when it was recognized and proposed as an elementary
                            particle)
                            may be
                            regarded as the moment when the proton was 'discovered'.</p>
                        <p>Rutherford knew hydrogen to be the simplest and lightest element and was influenced by <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prout%27s_hypothesis">Prout's hypothesis</a> that
                            hydrogen was
                            the building block of all elements. Discovery that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other
                            nuclei as an
                            elementary particle led Rutherford to give the hydrogen nucleus H+ a special name as a
                            particle,
                            since
                            he suspected that hydrogen, the lightest element, contained only one of these particles. He
                            named this
                            new fundamental building block of the nucleus the proton, after the neuter singular of the
                            Greek
                            word
                            for "first", πρῶτον. However, Rutherford also had in mind the word protyle as used by Prout.
                            Rutherford
                            spoke at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Science_Association">British
                                Association for
                                the Advancement of Science</a> at its <a

                            meeting beginning 24 August 1920.[23] At the meeting, he was asked by <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Lodge">Oliver Lodge</a> for a new name for
                            the
                            positive
                            hydrogen nucleus to avoid confusion with the neutral hydrogen atom. He initially suggested
                            both
                            proton
                            and prouton (after Prout).[24] Rutherford later reported that the meeting had accepted his
                            suggestion
                            that the hydrogen nucleus be named the "proton", following Prout's word "protyle".[25] The
                            first
                            use of
                            the word "proton" in the scientific literature appeared in 1920.</p>

                        lose

                        and it remains a proton. The attraction of low-energy free protons to any electrons present in
                        normal matter (such as the electrons in normal atoms) causes free protons to stop and to form a

                        interaction with any type of normal (non-plasma) matter, low-velocity free protons do not remain
                        free but are attracted to electrons in any atom or molecule with which they come into contact,

                    </p>
                    <p>Because the Solar Wind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometer">Spectrometer</a> made
                        continuous measurements, it was possible to measure how the <a

                        affects
                        arriving solar wind particles. For about two-thirds of each orbit, the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">Moon</a> is outside of the Earth's magnetic field.
                        At
                        these times, a typical proton density was 10 to 20 per cubic centimeter, with most protons
                        having
                        velocities between 400 and 650 kilometers per second. For about five days of each month, the
                        Moon is
                        inside the Earth's geomagnetic tail, and typically no solar wind particles were detectable. For
                        the
                        remainder of each lunar orbit, the Moon is in a transitional region known as the <a

                        field affects the solar wind, but does not completely exclude it. In this region, the particle
                        flux
                        is reduced, with typical proton velocities of 250 to 450 kilometers per second. During the lunar
                        night, the spectrometer was shielded from the solar wind by the Moon and no solar wind particles
                        were measured.</p>
                    <p>Protons also have extrasolar origin from galactic <a

                        90% of
                        the total particle flux. These protons often have higher energy than solar wind protons, and
                        their
